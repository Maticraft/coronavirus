# 2019 POLAND Coronavirus data (COVID-19 / 2019-nCoV)

This public repository archives data over time from various public sources on the web. Data was collected by GeoSiN Scientific Club Members from University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland (www.geosin.pl). 

Data is presented as a CSV file where every row is a single event (Infection/Death/Recovery) with the date, city, province and personal information about the patient.

I hope that this data will be useful to those producing visualizations or analyses.
