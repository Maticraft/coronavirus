# Coronavirus infections in Poland, 2020, dataset (COVID-19 / 2019-nCoV)

The dataset contains the latest available public data on COVID-19 infections in Poland. Data is presented as a CSV file where every row is a single event (Infection/Death/Recovery) with the date, city, province and personal information about the patient.

# Comments to dataset

## 18/03/2020
The government map about the diagnosed patients was generalized to voivodeships. The earlier map was divided into counties. Now, if we cannot match patients to their cities, the value in the 'city' column is the capital of the county (1) or, if it is unavailable, voivodeships. Sometimes some values may be updated later. 

## 17/03/2020 
Since yesterday the Ministry of Health stopped inform about cities where patients were diagnosed. We have information only about voivodeships. 

We hope that this data will be useful to those producing visualizations or analyses.

Data was collected by GeoSiN Scientific Club Members from University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland (www.geosin.pl).
